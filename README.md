npm install
```

#### For Django Notification System:
```sh
cd ../flutterAlerts
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
*Ensure you have Python and `pip` installed on your system.*

#### For Intel OneAPI:
1. **Download Intel OneAPI Toolkit**:
   - Visit the [Intel OneAPI Toolkit](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/oneapi.html) page.
   - Download the appropriate version for your operating system.

2. **Install Intel OneAPI**:
   - Follow the installation instructions provided on the Intel website.
   - After installation, ensure that the environment variables are set correctly. You can typically do this by sourcing the `setvars.sh` script:
     ```sh
     source /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh
     ```

### 4. Set Up Firebase
- Configure your Firebase project.
- Add the `google-services.json` (for Android) or `GoogleService-Info.plist` (for iOS) files to the appropriate directories.
- Update the Firebase configuration in your Flutter project as needed.

### 5. Configure Environment Variables
Ensure that both the Node.js and Django applications have the necessary environment variables set. You can create `.env` files in their respective directories based on the provided `.env.example` templates.

### 6. Run the Applications

#### Start the Node.js Backend Server:
```sh
cd ../node-server
node server.js
```

#### Start the Django Notification Server:
Open a new terminal window/tab and navigate to the Django directory:
```sh
cd backend/django
python manage.py runserver
```

#### Run the Flutter Frontend:
Open another terminal window/tab and navigate to the project root:
```sh
cd ../../
flutter run
```

*Ensure that the Node.js server, Django server, and Intel OneAPI are properly configured and running concurrently to enable full functionality.*

# IoT - AI

For IntelGenAI  Hackathon

This project aims to make the best use of IoT data using a flutter built app. It is used

1) To monitor and control building parameters from the admin side with help of IoT

2) Runs various ML models on input data for uses like predictive maintenance of machines, prediction of water quality and potability based on parameters of the water, solar power output prediction, fire recognition from live video feed, sign language detection from live video feed and facial recognition for intrusion detection

3) The users are able to see the value of environmental factors they are exposed to and are able to get recommmendations from Gemini AI for their health tailored with their personal health data just like Gemini gives admins building recommendations

4) The users can anonymous send feedbacks to admins and are also able to connect to doctors while their account willbe groupeed based on their physical location
